#  Reverse a Linked List

##  Problem Description

Implement a method to **reverse a singly linked list**.

You must demonstrate two approaches:

1. **Using Python's built-in `list.reverse()` method**
2. **Manually reversing** the linked list by iterating through it

---

## Goals

- Understand how singly linked lists work
- Practice rebuilding a linked list from reversed values
- Strengthen understanding of iteration, node creation, and pointers

---

##  Files

- `linked_list_reverse.py` â€” contains:
  - `Node` and `LinkedList` classes
  - `.reverse()` method using `list.reverse()`
  - `.manual_reverse()` method for manual reversal
  - `.print()` method to display list content
